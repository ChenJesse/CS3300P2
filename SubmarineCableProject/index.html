        <!-- <p>Fiber optic cables use glass (or plastic) threads (fibers) to transmit data. These threads are capable of transmitting
            messages modulated onto light waves. Fiber optics is a particularly popular technology for local-area networks
            and many telephone companies have begun to adopt it in place of traditional telephone lines.</p> -->

        <h2>What are Submarine Cables?</h2>
        <!-- Definition from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable -->
        <p>A submarine communications cable is a cable laid on the sea bed between land-based stations to carry telecommunication signals across stretches of ocean. Many of these cables were established in the early 90's and are used extensively around the world for internet and data communication. These cables greatly impact the overall Internet use and Internet penetration of a country. Something that can be further explored blow.</p>

        <h2>What is the Human Development Index (HDI)?</h2>
        <!-- Definition from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index -->
        <p>The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and income per capita indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development. A country scores higher HDI when the life expectancy at birth is longer, the education period is longer, and the income per capita is higher. </p>

        <h1>World Map</h1>
        <!-- <p>Our world map is the main interactive feature of the website. There are various levels of data embedded throughout the map. Each country holds data for Internet penetration, average internet use, bandwidth, and other internet statistics. Clicking on a country or wire will zoom into the selected area and bring up a line graph with various other statistics relating to the country's economy.</p> -->
        <h3>Internet Penetration</h3>
          <p>One of our main approaches to this world map is to show how these submarine cables have impacted countries' Internet use and determine if there was a relationship between these cables and a country's economy over time. At first glance, it is easy to see that the countries with greater internet penetration have many more wires leading into them. Areas such as Europe, North America and parts of South America clearly have greater internet penetration than Africa and some of Asia.</p>
        <h3>Cable Network</h3>
          <p>The cable network shows a clear shift from regions with greater Internet penetration, as mentioned above, to regions with much lower penetration. The map indicates that many of the newer cables are being built around Africa. This led us to explore what impacts these cables may have had on currently connected countries and what may lay in store for countries that are just now joining the global network.</p>
        <h2>Impact on Economy</h2>
          <p>We wanted to further explore the connection between countries and internet. To do this, we decided to look into economic factors and how these fiber optic cables may or may not have played a role. When you click on a country, a graph will appear with the specified countries' GDP per capita. Additionally, on the graph will be an indicator showing all the wires that link into the country and what year they were ready for service.</p>
