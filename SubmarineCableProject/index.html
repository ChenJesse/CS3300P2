        <!-- <p>Fiber optic cables use glass (or plastic) threads (fibers) to transmit data. These threads are capable of transmitting
            messages modulated onto light waves. Fiber optics is a particularly popular technology for local-area networks
            and many telephone companies have begun to adopt it in place of traditional telephone lines.</p> -->

        <h2>What are Submarine Cables?</h2>
        <!-- Definition from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable -->
        <p class="explanation">A submarine communications cable is a cable laid on the sea bed between land-based stations to carry telecommunication signals across stretches of ocean. Many of these cables were established in the early 90's and are used extensively around the world for internet and data communication. These cables greatly impact the overall internet usage of a country.</p>

        <h2>What is GDP per capita?</h2>
        <p class="explanation"> GDP is a monetary measure of the value of all final goods and services produced in a period, and it is arguably the most famous indicator of economic activity of a country. When we divide a GDP by the population of a country, we get GDP per capita, which
        is then an indicator for the average amount that a person makes.</p>

        <h2>OK, so how do these relate to each other? </h2>
        <p class="explanation">We believed that there should be a correlation between the construction of these cables, and an improvement in not
        only the country's total economic growth, but growth on a personal basis. Our thought process was that having the internet should have
        positive effects on education and productivity, and thus lead to an increase in GDP per capita, especially in countries that are just beginning
        to ramp up development.
        You can decide if we were right or wrong by exploring the map below! </p>

        <!-- <h2>Cable Network</h3>
          <p>The cable network shows a clear shift from regions with greater Internet penetration, as mentioned above, to regions with much lower penetration. The map indicates that many of the newer cables are being built around Africa. This led us to explore what impacts these cables may have had on currently connected countries and what may lay in store for countries that are just now joining the global network.</p>
        <h2>Impact on Economy</h2>
          <p>We wanted to further explore the connection between countries and internet. To do this, we decided to look into economic factors and how these fiber optic cables may or may not have played a role. When you click on a country, a graph will appear with the specified countries' GDP per capita. Additionally, on the graph will be an indicator showing all the wires that link into the country and what year they were ready for service.</p> -->
        <h2>Things we noticed</h2>
        <p class="explanation">Purely from the country coloring, we can see that South America and Asia seem to be having very rapid growth. Europe and Africa also seem to have sections with fast growing GDP per capita. Focusing on the purple lines (recently created or planned cables), we see a few being constructed around South America, many around the Mediterranean and Arabian seas, and a multitude being constructed in East Asia.
        Therefore, there does seem to be a pattern, but it is by no means a perfect correlation. The fact that we used percentage growth also
        makes it harder for established countries to have growth that competes with 3rd world countries as well.</p>
        <p class="explanation">We did notice a trend, in which the construction of submarine cables seems to be a leading indicator of economic growth
        for many of the developing countries. That would make sense, as investing in infrastructure, such as submarine cables, should lead to
        future growth.</p>
