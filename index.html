        <h2>What are Submarine Cables?</h2>
        <!-- Definition from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable -->
        <p class="explanation">A submarine communications cable is a cable laid on the sea bed between land-based stations to carry telecommunication signals across stretches of ocean. Many of these cables were established in the early 90's and are used extensively around the world for internet and data communication. These cables greatly impact the overall internet usage of a country.</p>

        <h2>What is GDP per capita?</h2>
        <p class="explanation"> GDP is a monetary measure of the value of all final goods and services produced in a period, and it is arguably the most famous indicator of economic activity of a country. When we divide a GDP by the population of a country, we get GDP per capita, which
        is then an indicator for the average amount that a person makes.</p>

        <h2>OK, so how do these relate to each other? </h2>
        <p class="explanation">We believed that there should be a correlation between the construction of these cables, and an improvement in not
        only the country's total economic growth, but growth on a personal basis. Our thought process was that having the internet should have
        positive effects on education and productivity, and thus lead to an increase in GDP per capita, especially in countries that are just beginning
        to ramp up development.

        <h2>Things we noticed</h2>
        <p class="explanation">Purely from the country coloring, we can see that South America and Asia seem to be having very rapid growth. Europe and Africa also seem to have sections with fast growing GDP per capita. Focusing on the purple lines (recently created or planned cables), we see a few being constructed around South America, many around the Mediterranean and Arabian seas, and a multitude being constructed in East Asia.
        Therefore, there does seem to be a pattern, but it is by no means a perfect correlation. The fact that we used percentage growth also
        makes it harder for established countries to have growth that competes with 3rd world countries as well.</p>
        <p class="explanation">We did notice a trend, in which the construction of submarine cables seems to be a leading indicator of economic growth
        for many of the developing countries. That would make sense, as investing in infrastructure, such as submarine cables, should lead to
        future growth.</p>
